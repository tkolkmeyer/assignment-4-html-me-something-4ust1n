            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">In 2010, my family and I visited Key West, Florida, the southernmost point of the United States. As seen in the picture, the buoy was a great place to visit as to showcase the lowest latitude land point in U.S. Also cannot leave out the great
                local food too. The Stoned Crab was a great local resturant, not only was the Crab good but also our table view was right next to the water.

            <p>
                Both in 2008 and 2010, my family and I visited Disney World located in Orlando, Florida. In 2010, it was part of the same trip to Key West and it was awesome. My favorite part would have to be in Magic Kingdom, such as Space Mountain, Splash Mountain,
                and the churros. I remember the lines at each ride were to the point we waited hours to get on each ride. While the wait was quite long, the eventual moment when it was our turn was worth it. Especially with churros on hand to eat while
                we wait.

            <p>
                In 2015, my family and I visited San Diego, California. We traveled by airplane and it was awesome to view all the different landmarks through the west such as the the Rocky Mountains. The water was definitely colder than Flordia waters but I digress.
                Since San Diego has many military instalations, I see many military members on our flight, at the store, and in the city. San Diego Zoo was lots of fun, lots of animals to view, the cheetahs were my favorite. Overall, great trip, would
                go again, and possibly take a drive up to LA while I am at it.
